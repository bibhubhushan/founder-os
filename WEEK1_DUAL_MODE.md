# Week 1 Dual-Mode Plan

Use this if your week has two realities:
- Founder Mode: building your own startup product
- Freelancer Mode: handling changing freelance/client jobs

Goal: dogfood FounderOS for 7 days, then release.

## Daily Rule

Pick one primary mode each day.  
Do not mix both modes in the same work block.

## Founder Mode

Primary metric:
- one shipped product outcome per day

Command flow:
1. `/strategist` for direction and leverage
2. `/operator` for task breakdown
3. `/builder` for implementation
4. `/designer` for UX polish
5. Log outcome in `PROOF_BOARD.md`

## Freelancer Mode

Primary metric:
- on-time delivery for current client task

Command flow:
1. `/operator` for scope and deadline plan
2. `/builder` for delivery
3. `/designer` if presentation/UX is needed
4. `/teacher` for fast gap-filling on unknown topics
5. Log outcome in `PROOF_BOARD.md`

## If Jobs Change Mid-Week

Use this intake template before starting:

```text
Client:
Task:
Deadline:
Definition of done:
Risks:
Estimated hours:
```

Then run `/operator` with that template and ship the smallest accepted version first.

## 7-Day Execution

Day 1:
- Founder Mode: define one weekly product metric and baseline
- Freelancer Mode: define one delivery metric and baseline

Day 2:
- Founder Mode: ship one small product improvement
- Freelancer Mode: deliver one client task end-to-end

Day 3:
- Founder Mode: improve onboarding or setup clarity
- Freelancer Mode: reduce revision risk with clearer deliverable spec

Day 4:
- Founder Mode: collect one proof artifact (quote/metric)
- Freelancer Mode: collect one client feedback quote

Day 5:
- Founder Mode: run a fresh-start test from zero context
- Freelancer Mode: run a handoff-quality check for deliverables

Day 6:
- Founder Mode: complete two focused build sessions
- Freelancer Mode: complete two focused delivery sessions

Day 7:
- Founder Mode: summarize wins, blockers, and release readiness
- Freelancer Mode: summarize repeatable workflow for changing jobs

## Release Gate (After Week 1)

Release only if all pass:
- 5+ complete sessions logged in `memory/JOURNAL.md`
- 3+ proof entries in `PROOF_BOARD.md`
- time to first useful output is under 5 minutes
- no recurring blocker appears 3 times
