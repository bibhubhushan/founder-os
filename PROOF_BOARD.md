# FounderOS Proof Board

Goal: collect evidence that FounderOS creates real outcomes, not just interest.

## Why This Exists

Virality without proof decays fast.  
Proof converts attention into trust, stars, users, and referrals.

## KPI Targets (Week 1)

- 5 user quotes
- 3 before/after outcomes
- 2 public build stories
- 1 repeat user story
