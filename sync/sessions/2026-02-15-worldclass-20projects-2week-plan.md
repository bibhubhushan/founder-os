# World-Class 20 Projects — 2 Week Plan

**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Owner:** Aria (Codex)
**Primary Goal:** Publish 20 world-class projects in 14 days.
**Constraints:** Zero paid AI API, high pace each working hour, Codex + Antigravity active, Claude Code unavailable.

## Phase 0 — Research First (Day 0)

1. Run primary deep research from `sync/tasks/chatgpt-deep-research.md`.
2. If extra lanes are available, run `sync/tasks/gemini-web.md` in parallel.
3. Merge all research outputs into one shortlist.
4. Run Claude Web quality gate.
5. Freeze final 20 projects before build starts.

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Days 1-2)

1. Create monorepo orchestration scripts and project scaffolding templates.
2. Build documentation system from NotebookLM outputs.
3. Finalize quality rubric and acceptance checklist for every repo.

## Phase 2 — Production Sprint (Days 3-12)

Build in parallel lanes:

- Lane A (Codex): 1 primary repo at a time + scaffolding automation
- Lane B (Antigravity): 1 primary repo at a time + UI quality polish
- Lane C (Template lane): docs, screenshots, demos, cleanup

Target pace:

- 2 completed repos per day for Days 3-10
- 2 integration/polish days (Days 11-12)

## Phase 3 — Finalization (Days 13-14)

1. Final QA pass for all 20 repos.
2. Portfolio index README and curation.
3. Final publish pass and pinned repo arrangement.
4. Sprint report and retrospective.

## World-Class Acceptance Criteria (per project)

1. Clear problem and user.
2. Non-generic differentiator.
3. Clean architecture and setup.
4. Strong README with screenshots.
5. Functional demo path.
6. Free-stack compliance.
7. Evidence of engineering quality (tests/logging/error handling where relevant).

## Daily Operating Rhythm

1. Start of day: 20-minute standup + reprioritization.
2. Each working hour: one measurable deliverable.
3. End of day: publish what is complete, log progress in memory/sessions.
