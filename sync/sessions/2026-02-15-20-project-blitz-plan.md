# 20-Project Blitz Plan

> Superseded on 2026-02-15 by `sync/sessions/2026-02-15-worldclass-20projects-2week-plan.md`.
> Keep for history only.

**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Owner:** Aria (Codex)
**Goal:** Publish 20 portfolio projects to GitHub in one day.
**Constraint:** No paid AI API or paid platform dependency.

## Phase 1 — Research Lock (Parallel Gemini)

1. Run 2 Gemini sessions + 1 SuperGrok session from `sync/tasks/gemini-web.md`.
2. Merge outputs into final shortlist of 20 projects.
3. Run Claude Web stress-test for keep/remove decisions.
4. Freeze final 20 list before coding.

## Phase 2 — Build Batching Strategy

Build in 5 batches of 4 repos each:

- **Batch A (Fast wins):** 1-2 hour projects
- **Batch B (Fast wins):** 1-2 hour projects
- **Batch C (Medium):** 2-4 hour projects
- **Batch D (Medium):** 2-4 hour projects
- **Batch E (Stretch):** 3-5 hour projects

## Project Card Standard (for all 20)

- Repo name
- Problem statement
- MVP scope (max 3 core features)
- Free stack only
- Setup instructions
- Demo data/source
- Screenshot or gif

## GitHub Publish Standard

Every repo must include:

- `README.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `.gitignore`
- Basic run instructions
- At least one screenshot/gif

## Quality Gate

Reject any project that:

- Requires paid API to function
- Cannot be demoed quickly
- Looks generic without differentiation

## Execution Notes

- Prioritize breadth with clean presentation.
- Keep code small and focused.
- Ship each repo as soon as it is runnable.
