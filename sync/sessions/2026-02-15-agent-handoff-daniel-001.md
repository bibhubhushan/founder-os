# Agent Handoff

**Date:** 2026-02-15
**From:** aria
**To:** daniel
**Context:** User requested immediate multi-platform assignment (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, NotebookLM, Antigravity) and authorized Daniel to build aggressively. Use the 10-task pack and frozen shortlist.

**Completed:**
- Created 10-task cross-agent assignment: `sync/tasks/cross-agent-10pack.md`
- Added Antigravity strategy tasks: `sync/tasks/antigravity.md`
- Confirmed frozen shortlist exists: `sync/inbox/2026-02-15-claude-web-worldclass-20project-quality-gate.md`
- Captured Grok snapshot input: `sync/inbox/2026-02-15-supergrok-account-1-quality-and-ranking.md`

**Open Questions:**
- Which first 5 repos should be prioritized if today has <12 focused build hours?
- Should Daniel start from fastest wins (4-8h set) or highest-signal flagship first?

**Next Step:**
Start Batch A now from frozen GO list:
1. `prompt-eval-lab`
2. `browser-qa-agent`
3. `api-contract-guardian`
4. `accessibility-autofix-ci`
5. `green-ci-profiler`

Apply only explicit deltas from new research outputs (`2026-02-16` files) and do not wait for all tasks to finish before coding Batch A.
