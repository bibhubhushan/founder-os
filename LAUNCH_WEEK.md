# Launch Sprint (24 Hours + 7 Days)

Goal: create a breakout launch around one painful truth.

## Positioning (Non-Negotiable)

**"FounderOS helps you build agentically without API-key setup pain."**

If a post, demo, or reply does not reinforce that line, cut it.

## 24-Hour Strike Plan

### Hour 0-2: Prepare Assets
- Lock README headline and CTA
- Record one 20-30 second demo: setup -> command -> result
- Prepare one visual with social proof placeholders (stars, users, quotes)

### Hour 2-3: Launch Post
- Post a short launch on X with demo and repo link
- Pin the post
- First CTA: "Star the repo if this removes API pain for you"

### Hour 3-8: Aggressive Distribution
- Reply to 50 relevant founder/dev posts with useful comments
- Send 20 targeted DMs to builders who already post about AI tooling
- Share one proof update every 90 minutes (stars, testimonials, fixes shipped)

### Hour 8-24: Convert Attention
- Release one tiny improvement based on comments
- Post a follow-up thread with "what changed in 1 day"
- Ask for a specific contribution: stars, issue reports, or first PRs

## 7-Day Expansion Plan

### Day 2
- Publish "How to run FounderOS in 30 seconds" clip
- Add first user quote to README

### Day 3
- Launch a 7-day public build challenge
- Share 3 real user use-cases

### Day 4
- Ship top 3 requested fixes
- Post changelog screenshot and tag contributors

### Day 5
- Publish one contrarian thread: why API friction kills agentic adoption
- Cross-post in 3 communities (founders + indie hackers + devs)

### Day 6
- Publish "before vs after" workflows from users
- Push another release with visible wins

### Day 7
- Share full launch metrics and lessons
- Announce next milestone and invite collaborators

## Metrics That Matter

- `stars_24h` target: 100+
- `setup_attempts_24h` target: 50+
- `qualified_replies_24h` target: 30+
- `user_quotes_week1` target: 5+

## Kill Criteria

If `stars_24h < 30`, reposition message the same day and relaunch with a tighter niche:
- Solo founders shipping MVP in 7 days
- Non-technical founders using AI teams
- Builders blocked on API-key setup
