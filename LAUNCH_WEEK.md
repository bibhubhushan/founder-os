# Launch Week Plan (Go Viral Fast)

Goal: get as many founders using this in 7 days as possible.

## One-Liner

**"FounderOS: 5 AI agents that help you build your startup. No API keys. Free."**

What you're promising:
- Plan your week faster
- Remember every decision
- Ship more, forget less

## Day-by-Day Plan

### Day 1: Get it Ready
- Clean up README, examples, and docs
- Record one 60-second demo (just show it working)
- Put out v1.0.0

### Day 2: Spread the Word
- Write your launch posts (X + LinkedIn + founder groups)
- Take some screenshots of the landing page
- Make a list of 20 founders to DM

### Day 3: Get People to Try It
- DM 20 founders: "Try this for one day and tell me what you think"
- Ask each one: what worked? what didn't?
- Fix the top 3 problems right away

### Day 4: Show Results
- Share 3 short before/after stories from testers
- Push v1.0.1 with fixes
- Post a "how I planned my week in 10 minutes" thread

### Day 5: Build Momentum
- Start a 7-day challenge: "Ship something with FounderOS every day"
- Share example prompts from `examples/`
- Get people to post about building in public

### Day 6: Make More Content
- Write one post: "Why most founders waste time without a system"
- Share clips and screenshots everywhere
- Post answers to common questions

### Day 7: Keep Going
- Share your week's numbers
- Invite people to contribute (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- Ask what features people want next

## What You Need to Make

- 1 demo video (60 seconds)
- 3 screenshots showing it in action
- 1 before/after comparison
- 3 short quotes from people who tried it

## Track These Every Day

- GitHub stars
- How many people finished setup
- How many people actually used it to ship
- How many came back after 2 days

If something isn't working after 2 days, switch to DMing founders directly.
