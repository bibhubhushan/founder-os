## Core One-Liner

FounderOS is an open-source AI startup team that lets founders build agentically without API-key setup pain.

## 15-Second Pitch

I built FounderOS for founders who want agentic workflows without setup friction.  
It gives you 5 specialized AI agents for strategy, ops, code, design, and research, with persistent local memory and no API-key setup.

## 45-Second Pitch

FounderOS solves a practical problem: most people cannot sustain agentic workflows because setup is painful and context gets lost.  
It gives founders a role-based AI team with clear commands and persistent memory, so strategy, execution, and learning do not collapse into one messy chat.  
It works in Codex, Claude Code, and Antigravity, and it is open source.

## 2-Minute Pitch

Most builders are not blocked by ideas. They are blocked by execution systems.

The current agentic stack has three failures:
- setup friction from API keys and tool wiring
- no role clarity between strategy, build, ops, and design
- context loss between sessions

FounderOS fixes that with a team of five AI specialists:
- ORACLE for strategy and differentiation
- PULSE for planning and execution
- FORGE for building
- PIXEL for design
- SAGE for research and learning

It runs inside Codex, Claude Code, and Antigravity, and uses persistent local memory so decisions compound over time.

The mission is simple: make FounderOS the fastest way for a founder to go from idea to shipped output with an agentic workflow in minutes.

## Sharp Positioning (Use This Language)

- "Build agentically without API-key setup pain."
- "From messy AI chats to role-based execution."
- "Persistent memory so your decisions compound."

## Avoid This Language

- "AI for everyone"
- "all-in-one platform for everything"
- generic "productivity tool" language
