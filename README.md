# FounderOS

### 5 AI agents that help you build your startup. No API keys. Totally free.

> You don't need money to have a great team. Just clone this and start.

---

Most founders waste time doing three things:
- Deciding the same stuff again every week
- Mixing strategy, coding, and design in one messy chat
- Forgetting what they decided last session

**FounderOS fixes all three.** You get 5 AI agents, each good at one thing. They remember your past decisions. And they work inside Antigravity without any API keys.

## Your Team

| Who | What they do | Command |
|---|---|---|
| **ELON** | Thinks big. Challenges your strategy. | `/ceo` |
| **SATOSHI** | Plans your week. Keeps you shipping. | `/coo` |
| **DANIEL** | Builds stuff. Code, architecture, systems. | `/cto` |
| **BRIAN** | Makes it look good. UX, design, flow. | `/cdo` |
| **ANDREJ** | Teaches you. Fills knowledge gaps. | `/cro` |

## Before vs After

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Same decisions every week | Agents remember everything |
| One messy AI chat for everything | Right agent for the right job |
| Forget what you did last time | Full history saved locally |
| Pay for API keys | Free forever |

## Get Started (30 seconds)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bibhubhushan/founder-os.git
cd founder-os
```

Open the folder in **Antigravity** and type:

```
/ceo What makes us different?
/coo Plan my week
/team_mvp Build this in 72 hours
```

That's it. No setup. No config. No keys.

## Want a browser dashboard?

```bash
./run_local.sh 8787
# open http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

You get a full dashboard with chat, memory editor, and all commands. Runs on Python (already on your machine). No installs needed.

## All Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/route` | Figures out which agent you need |
| `/coo` | Plan your sprint, set tasks |
| `/ceo` | Challenge your idea, find your edge |
| `/cto` | Build, debug, pick the right tech |
| `/cdo` | Design it, make it feel right |
| `/cro` | Learn something deeply |
| `/team_mvp` | Strategy + build + design together |
| `/cofounder` | Big picture + execution together |
| `/core_team` | All builders check in |
| `/all_hands` | Everyone weighs in on a big call |

## How it works

1. **Clone** this repo
2. **Open in Antigravity** — agents load automatically from the files
3. **Type a command** — you get routed to the right agent
4. **Your memory saves** — decisions, lessons, journal all persist
5. **Come back tomorrow** — everything is still there

- You use Antigravity but API keys are too expensive
- You want your AI to actually remember your past sessions
