# Start Here (Antigravity)

Use this file when setting up FounderOS for the first time.

## Step 1: Set Project Context

Open `memory/ACTIVE_PROJECT.md` and fill:
- Project name
- Target user
- Current goal
- Next ship milestone

## Step 2: Pick Today’s Mode

- Need direction: `/ceo`
- Need task plan: `/coo`
- Need to build now: `/cto`
- Need design: `/cdo`
- Not sure: `/route [your request]`

If you want the browser UI, run `./run_local.sh 8787` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.

## Step 3: Run One Focused Session

Use this format:

```text
Objective: [one outcome]
Deadline: [date]
Constraints: [time/team/tech]
Done when: [binary success condition]
```

## Step 4: Persist Memory (Non-Negotiable)

At end of session update:
- `memory/DECISIONS.md`
- `memory/JOURNAL.md`
- `memory/LESSONS.md`
- `memory/EVALS.md`

## Step 5: Repeat Daily

Run the same loop every day for 7 days before changing the system.
