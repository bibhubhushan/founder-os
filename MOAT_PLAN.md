# FounderOS Moat Plan (90 Days)

Goal: make FounderOS harder to replace than to copy.

## Moat 1: Workflow Depth

Make the role-based agent workflow materially better than generic chat.

Actions:
- Ship tighter command flows for common founder tasks.
- Add scenario templates in `examples/` for recurring startup jobs.
- Reduce time-to-first-action to under 5 minutes.

Metric:
- `% users who complete one workflow and return in 48h`

## Moat 2: Memory Quality

Turn persistent memory into a compounding advantage.

Actions:
- Standardize memory updates at session end.
- Add better prompts for decision logging and lesson extraction.
- Track decision revisit rate and reduce it weekly.

Metric:
- `decision revisit rate` and `weekly repeat usage`

## Moat 3: Public Proof Density

Own the narrative with outcomes, not claims.

Actions:
- Publish at least one proof artifact daily (quote, metric, case).
- Keep `PROOF_BOARD.md` current and link wins in launch posts.
- Add a README section with real user outcomes.

Metric:
- `proof artifacts/week` and `star-to-user conversion rate`

## Moat 4: Distribution Graph

Build a distribution loop around founders and builders.

Actions:
- Run weekly challenge posts ("ship with FounderOS in 7 days").
- Reply daily to relevant founder/dev threads with useful insight.
- Build a small ambassador list of early users who repost launches.

Metric:
- `qualified mentions/week` and `inbound demo requests`

## Execution Cadence

- Every day: one proof artifact + one distribution burst.
- Every week: one release with visible user-driven changes.
- Every month: one major narrative post with metrics and lessons.
