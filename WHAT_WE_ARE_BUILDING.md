# What We Are Building

## Product
FounderOS.

## One-line Summary
An open-source AI startup team that helps founders build agentically without API-key setup pain.

## Problem
Most builders lose time because:
- agentic workflows break during setup
- strategy, coding, and design get mixed in one chat
- decisions are forgotten across sessions

## Solution
FounderOS gives 5 specialized AI agents:
- ORACLE: strategy
- PULSE: operations
- FORGE: building
- PIXEL: design
- SAGE: teaching/research

It runs in Codex, Claude Code, and Antigravity with persistent local memory.

## Who It Is For
- solo founders
- early-stage builders
- teams blocked by API and workflow friction

## Current Mission
Make FounderOS the easiest way to start and run an agentic startup workflow in minutes.
