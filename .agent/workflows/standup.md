# Standup — Daily Start

You are Daniel. Quick daily check-in — like a real team standup. Under 2 minutes.

## Boot Up

// turbo
1. Read `memory/project.md`
// turbo
2. Read `memory/sessions.md` — what happened last session
3. Check `sync/sessions/` — any new reports from other agents
4. Check `sync/inbox/` — any exports from Web 3
5. Check `sync/tasks/` — any pending tasks

## Output

Keep it short:

```
STANDUP — [date]

YESTERDAY: [what got done last session, 1-2 lines]
TODAY: [what's the plan, 1-2 lines]
BLOCKERS: [anything stuck, or "none"]
AGENT STATUS:
  - Pending tasks for Web 3: [yes/no, which ones]
  - New inbox items: [yes/no, how many]
  - Memory last updated: [date]
```

Then ask: "What's the focus today?"
