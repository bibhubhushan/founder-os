# Contributing

Thanks for improving FounderOS.

## What We Accept

- Better workflows for founder productivity
- Clearer onboarding and documentation
- Safer defaults and memory reliability improvements
- New examples with real founder use cases

## Contribution Process

1. Open an issue describing the problem and expected behavior.
2. Submit a focused pull request.
3. Keep changes scoped; avoid unrelated refactors.
4. Update docs when behavior changes.
5. Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased`.

## Quality Bar

- Changes must keep the Antigravity-first approach.
- Avoid hardcoded local absolute paths.
- Preserve backward compatibility in command names unless clearly deprecated.
- Prefer deterministic workflows over vague prose.

## Suggested PR Format

Be direct, factual, and respectful.
