# FounderOS Workflow

This is the default operating model for shipping with FounderOS.

## 1. Weekly Loop

1. Choose one north-star metric for the week
2. Define at most 3 goals
3. Break goals into tasks with `/coo`
4. Ship with `/team_mvp` or `/cto`
5. Run Friday review and update memory

## 2. Build Pipeline

1. `ELON` (`/ceo`): validate direction and moat
2. `BRIAN` (`/cdo`): define UX and interaction
3. `DANIEL` (`/cto`): implement and test
4. `SATOSHI` (`/coo`): package into sprint and launch checklist
5. `ANDREJ` (`/cro`): document learnings and teach-backs

## 3. Escalation Modes

- Hard product decision: `/all_hands`
- Strategy + execution conflict: `/cofounder`
- Build sprint: `/team_mvp`
- Ambiguous request: `/route`

## 4. Session Closure

Every session ends with file updates:
- `memory/DECISIONS.md`
- `memory/JOURNAL.md`
- `memory/LESSONS.md`
- `memory/EVALS.md`

No memory update means no compounding.
