What was attempted: Viral launch positioning around agentic coding without API-key setup pain.
What shipped: Updated README hero copy, rebuilt `LAUNCH_WEEK.md` into a 24-hour strike plan, and rewrote `SOCIAL_POSTS.md` with high-conversion launch templates.
What failed: No public traction metrics yet; launch post and distribution loop not executed.
Next session focus: Publish launch post, run reply/DM distribution sprint, and collect first proof points (stars, quotes, setup completions).

Date: 2026-02-14 15:05
What was attempted: Upgrade from strategy to execution by solving the three weaknesses (broad messaging, low proof density, thin moat).
What shipped: Added `MESSAGING.md`, `PROOF_BOARD.md`, and `MOAT_PLAN.md`; updated `README.md` quickstart consistency and launch-kit links.
What failed: Still no live proof artifacts from users yet.
Next session focus: Collect first 5 user proof entries and publish them with daily distribution.

Date: 2026-02-14 15:18
What was attempted: Add operational sync and first-week usage model for mixed founder workload.
What shipped: Added `sync_memory.sh` and `WEEK1_DUAL_MODE.md`, and linked both from `README.md`.
What failed: Git remote/auth is still not configured, so sync script push path is not test-validated yet.
Next session focus: Connect GitHub remote, run `./sync_memory.sh`, and start Day 1 of dual-mode plan.

Date: 2026-02-14 16:02
What was attempted: Create a handoff-ready user manual for first-time use by another person.
What shipped: Added `USER_GUIDE.md` and linked it in `README.md` launch kit section.
What failed: Guide has not yet been validated by an actual first-time user.
Next session focus: Ask one new user to follow the guide and capture confusion points into `PROOF_BOARD.md`.

Date: 2026-02-14 16:20
What was attempted: Simplify all usage naming into two clear modes only.
What shipped: Updated docs to use `Founder Mode` and `Freelancer Mode` consistently in `WEEK1_DUAL_MODE.md`, `USER_GUIDE.md`, and `README.md`.
What failed: No external user validation of the updated wording yet.
Next session focus: Run one real day in each mode and record friction points.

Date: 2026-02-14 16:45
What was attempted: Reduce Antigravity command overload and enforce a mode-first onboarding path.
What shipped: Added `.agent/workflows/mode.md`, moved previous Antigravity workflows to `.agent/workflows_legacy/`, and updated `README.md` + `USER_GUIDE.md` to start with `/mode`.
What failed: Mode-first flow is implemented but still needs first-time user validation in Antigravity.
Next session focus: Validate with one new user and adjust the `/mode` prompt if any confusion remains.

Date: 2026-02-14 17:02
What was attempted: Implement stricter mode-gated access so no agent behavior runs before choosing a mode.
What shipped: Updated `.agent/workflows/mode.md` with mandatory access gate and added `memory/SESSION_MODE.md`; updated docs with in-mode agent call format.
What failed: Needs real-user validation in Antigravity UI to confirm mental model clarity.
Next session focus: Run one onboarding test and collect confusion points.
