# LESSONS LEARNED

Purpose: Capture mistakes and repeatable wins.

## Rules

- Write lessons as concrete rules.
- Keep each lesson short.
- Update after major wins/failures.

## Lessons

- Keep scope fixed during the sprint.
- Ship a smaller version before adding complexity.
- Log decisions immediately to avoid drift.
- Generic launch messaging underperforms; lead with one painful problem and one clear CTA.
- Claims do not compound; daily proof artifacts do.
- Cross-tool continuity requires explicit Git sync, not assumption.
- Simple naming conventions improve first-time user adoption.
- New users perform better with one entry command than a long command menu.
- Mode-gated access prevents premature agent calls and reduces onboarding errors.
- In freelancer onboarding, low-info user input should trigger a concrete fallback plan, not repeated clarifying questions.
