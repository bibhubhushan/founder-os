Decision: Run a same-day virality sprint for FounderOS focused on one channel and one flagship asset.
Options considered: Multi-channel broad posting; paid boosts; one-channel concentrated push.
Why this choice: Concentrated distribution gives the highest chance of breakout in 24 hours and is executable immediately.

Decision: Product narrative will center on API/setup friction, supported by a proof board and a 90-day moat plan.
Options considered: Broad "AI team for founders" narrative; feature-first narrative; pain-first narrative with proof.
Why this choice: Pain-first positioning is clearer, proof improves conversion, and moat planning protects against copycats.

Decision: Run a week-1 dual-mode dogfood process (startup track + freelance track) and use `sync_memory.sh` as default cross-tool memory sync.
Options considered: Single-track startup only; ad-hoc switching without protocol; dual-track with explicit mode rules.
Why this choice: Founder workload changes daily, so dual-mode structure reduces context loss and keeps execution measurable.

Decision: Add `USER_GUIDE.md` as a first-time handoff manual for non-technical users and family collaborators.
Options considered: Keep setup scattered across existing docs; create one dedicated onboarding guide.
Why this choice: A single guide reduces confusion, speeds adoption, and improves consistency across tools.

Decision: Standardize usage naming to exactly two labels: Founder Mode and Freelancer Mode.
Options considered: Keep mixed labels (startup/freelance/track A/B); simplify to two consistent mode names.
Why this choice: Consistent naming reduces onboarding confusion and makes daily switching faster.

Decision: Make Antigravity mode-first with a single visible entry command (`/mode`) and move other workflows to legacy.
Options considered: Keep full command list; trim only duplicates; mode-first single entrypoint.
Why this choice: New users were overloaded by the command picker. Mode-first onboarding reduces friction and confusion.
