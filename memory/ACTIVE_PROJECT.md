# ACTIVE PROJECT

Purpose: Current project context used by all agents.

## Current Project

- Name: FounderOS
- One-line summary: Open-source AI startup team that works in Codex/Claude/Antigravity with no API-key setup.
- Target user: Solo founders and early builders blocked by agentic setup friction.
- Current stage: Public launch and distribution sprint.
- Primary metric: GitHub stars in 24 hours.
- Deadline: 2026-02-14

## MVP Scope

- Must-have 1: Clear no-API-key setup flow.
- Must-have 2: Role-based agent commands for strategy, ops, build, design, and research.
- Must-have 3: Persistent memory updates across sessions.

## Current Priorities (Top 3)

1. Tighten positioning around API-friction pain.
2. Launch high-conversion social content and distribution loop.
3. Convert traffic to stars, first users, and testimonials.

## Blockers

- No proof-heavy public traction yet (quotes, outcomes, and win stories).

## Next Action

- Launch the primary X post with demo and run the 24-hour distribution sprint.
