## X Thread Opener

```text
Most founders don't need more prompts.

## LinkedIn Post

```text
I kept making the same planning mistakes every week. So I built FounderOS and open-sourced it.

What it does:
- 5 AI agents, each focused on one job (strategy, planning, building, design, learning)
- Saves your decisions so you never forget
- Gives you a simple weekly plan to keep shipping

Who it's for:
- Solo founders
- Small teams
- Anyone who ships every week

No API keys needed. Works in Antigravity. Free forever.
