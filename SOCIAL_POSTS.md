## X Post (Primary Launch)

```text
Most people can't code agentically because setup is a mess and every tool asks for API keys.

I built FounderOS to remove that friction:
- 5 AI agents (strategy, ops, build, design, research)
- Works in Codex, Claude Code, and Antigravity
- No API keys required

If this solves your setup pain, star it:
[repo-link]
```

## X Thread (Proof-Based)

```text
I think "agentic coding" won't go mainstream until setup is trivial.

So I built FounderOS (open source):
1) Clone repo
2) Open in Codex/Claude/Antigravity
3) Run role commands and ship

What I removed:
- API key setup overhead
- role confusion in one giant chat
- decision loss between sessions

If you're building this week, try it:
[repo-link]
```

## X Reply Templates (Distribution Engine)

```text
Useful point. I kept hitting the same issue: agentic workflows die at setup.
I open-sourced a no-key starter stack for this: [repo-link]
```

```text
Agree. Most people don't fail at prompting, they fail at workflow.
FounderOS gives role-based agents + persistent memory: [repo-link]
```

```text
This is exactly why I built FounderOS.
Goal: remove API friction and get people shipping in minutes: [repo-link]
```

## LinkedIn Post (Cleaner Positioning)

```text
Hot take: agentic coding adoption is blocked more by setup friction than model quality.

I built FounderOS to solve that:
- 5 specialized AI agents
- persistent memory across sessions
- works in Codex / Claude Code / Antigravity
- no API-key setup

It's open source and free.

If you're building a startup right now, test it and tell me where it breaks.

## DM Template (Warm Outreach)

```text
Hey [name], I built something I think you'll care about.
FounderOS helps founders run agentic workflows without API-key setup pain.

Would love your honest take after a 5-minute test:
