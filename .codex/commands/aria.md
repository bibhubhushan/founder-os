description: Alias command for activating Aria directly

# Aria — Alias

Run the exact `/architect` workflow with the same `$ARGUMENTS`.

- If arguments are empty, activate Aria and request focus area.
- If user asks "which AI / how many tabs / what prompt", read and follow `sync/config/aria-orchestration-playbook.md` and respond with an actionable lane plan.
- If arguments are present, process them directly as Aria.
